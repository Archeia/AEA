*I will not be giving support or fixing bugs for you. I don't have time for that.

*Please do not distribute them in one huge zip/rar/.7z/whatever compression without my permission.

*You may use or edit the code as you please as long as it has proper attribution. 

*Please add me in your credits either as Archeia/Division Heaven. It can be in the ReadMe/Game Credits/etc. 

*I am not liable for any destructive behavior that the materials could have caused you, such as, but not limited to, computer damage, incontinence, explosion of userâ€™s head, coma, death, and/or halitosis. So edit or use at your own risk.
