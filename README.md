Archeia Engine Ace
===

A collection of scripts made by me or exclusively for me that is tailored for public use. The scripts only work in RPG Maker VXAce unless stated otherwise. Contact me if you want commercial use of my scripts for your projects. You can find my website over here: http://archeia.moe/

*I will not be giving support or fixing bugs for you. I don't have time for that.

*Please do not distribute them in one huge zip/rar/.7z/whatever compression without my permission.

*You may use or edit the code as you please as long as it has proper attribution. However, you cannot change the license for the script e.g. removing the permission to use for commercial projects.

*Please add me in your credits either as Archeia/Division Heaven. It can be in the ReadMe/Game Credits/etc. 

*I am not liable for any destructive behavior that the materials could have caused you, such as, but not limited to, computer damage, incontinence, explosion of userâ€™s head, coma, death, and/or halitosis. So edit or use at your own risk.
